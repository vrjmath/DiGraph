# DiGraph

This project focuses on benchmarking various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on **directed graph datasets**.  
The goal is to evaluate model performance, scalability, and applicability across tasks involving directed graph structures.

## Features
- Benchmarking framework for multiple GNN architectures  
- Support for directed graph datasets  
- Flexible training and evaluation pipeline  

## Getting Started
To run the project, simply execute:
```bash
python train.py
